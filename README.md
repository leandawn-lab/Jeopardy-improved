# Jeopardy-improved

Good day, This is the first creation of my Personal Project regarding to improve my programming skills.

This is the first official project that I decided to put out of my expense.

In summary, this is a Jeopardy Program that I made using C++. I can't handle how to manage my code in C so I made a switch.

I can't neccesarily say that this is a Jeopardy Programm more like a Indentification.

As you can see, there's actually bugs here that I can't fix right now. I will fix it if I can.


Suggestions, and Feedbacks are always appreciated... Thank you!
